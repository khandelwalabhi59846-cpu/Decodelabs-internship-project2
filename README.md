# 💰 Expense Tracker – Project 2

A simple and beginner-friendly **Expense Tracker built with Python** that allows users to enter multiple expenses, calculates the total amount spent, and handles invalid or negative inputs safely.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Expense Tracker is a console-based Python application designed to make basic expense calculation simple and interactive.

Users can:

* Enter expenses one by one
* Add multiple expenses
* Prevent negative expense values
* Handle invalid input without crashing
* Stop entering expenses by entering `0`
* View the total amount spent

## ✨ Features

* 💵 **Add Expenses** – Enter expenses individually.
* ➕ **Automatic Total** – Calculates the total of all entered expenses.
* 🚫 **Negative Value Validation** – Prevents negative expense amounts.
* ⚠️ **Input Validation** – Handles invalid inputs using `try-except`.
* 🎯 **Exit Option** – Enter `0` to finish entering expenses.
* 📊 **Formatted Output** – Displays amounts with two decimal places.
* 🖥️ **Simple Console Interface** – Easy to use for beginners.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* `while` loop
* `if-else`
* `try-except`
* `float()`
* Formatted strings (f-strings)

## 🔄 How It Works

```text
Start
  ↓
Enter Expense
  ↓
Is the input valid?
  ├── No → Show error → Enter again
  └── Yes
       ↓
Is expense negative?
  ├── Yes → Show error → Enter again
  └── No
       ↓
Is expense 0?
  ├── Yes → Stop
  └── No → Add to Total
              ↓
         Enter next expense
              ↓
           Total Spent
```
